"editor.getCursor": (): number => {
  return editor.editorView!.state.selection.main.from;
},
"editor.getSelection": (): { from: number; to: number } => {
  return editor.editorView!.state.selection.main;
},

Text.lineAt(pos)

So to get cursor line / char:

let cursor = editorView.state.selection.main.from;
let line = editorView.state.doc.lineAt(cursor);
let lineNo = line.number;
let charNo = cursor - line.from;


Things present in notepad2 but not in notepad2web:
* Exit menu and toolbar icon
* Alt-F11 shortcut for toggle menu
* zoom in / out : using browser zooming instead

The reason for those are restrictions of the browser.
Some keyboard shortcuts cannot be intercepted.
Some functionality is not available in the browser.
Some functionality can't be implemented in Code Mirror.
Some functionality is too hard to implement in Code Mirror.

Specific things:

IDM_VIEW_HIGHLIGHTCURRENTLINE_SUBLINE - when line is wrapped, Scintilla has an option (turned by default) to only highlight the first line of wrapped line. CodeMirror doesn't have that

IDM_VIEW_HIGHLIGHTCURRENT_BLOCK - CodeMirror doesn't do that
