--- tabs
- when creating a new note must ask for title first
- implement opening a new tab: if Ctrl is pressed when ntoe is selected, the note is opened in a new tab at the end
- fix closing a tab
- fix setting a state
- indicate currently selected tab in the url (e.g. by appeding ;2 at the end, which indicates that tab 2 is selected)

--- misc
- call deleteRemoteStoreCache() when logging out. used to be in useRemoteStore() but that's called on startup which was killing the cache

Done:
- [X] implement renaming a note
- [X] don't allow closing the only tab
- [X] don't show close tab if only one tab shown
- [x] move setNavigationCallback() to Noted.svelte
- [x] move Editor.navigate() to Noted.svelte and make it handle tabs. if navigating to a tab that is already opened, simply switches to that tab. If navigates to new note, replace current tab with that note. Maybe add a flag "newTab" which will open a new tab instead of replacing content
